* Changes in intlfonts 1.2

** Configurization

You can use `configure' script for the installation.

** BDF file name changed for DOS.

As DOS has a limit on file name length (8+3), most of BDF file names
have been changed.  For instance, etl16-latin1.bdf is changed to
lt1-16-etl.bdf.   The generic rule of file name is:
	Charset[-]SizeStyle[-Subscript].bdf

** Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic styles are added.

Now several fonts have these variants.

** Type1 and TrueType fonts are added for Latin-X, Thai, and Vietnamese.

Though, these fonts are not yet used by Emacs.

** New file Emacs.ap contains sample X resource setting.
